### TODO:

1. Ajustable height and width of SVG (2h)

- I think the current size you have is fine and works on both desktop and mobile. It's what I based my design on. It may look different because of the image resize in shopify.

2. Centered responsive layout (1h)

- Would be nice but low priority.

3. M to cm toggle (or just cm) (1h)

- Just CM is higher priority than a toggle for M to CM.

4. centimeters to feet/inches toggle at the bottom (1h)

- High priority

5. Shading depth grey rather than the jump (1h)
6. Ui updates close to design https://cutlaps.com/pages/kicker-calculator (2h)

- slider color change
- names
- fonts
- underlines

7. Packages update (2h)
